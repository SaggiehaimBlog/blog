Hi, I am Saggie, a cloud and AI security architect, blogger, and trainer. I help large international enterprises design modern SOC architectures and move to the cloud securely and in line with compliance.

Today I am a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. I lead demos and proofs of concept for Microsoft Security, help customers adopt Defender for Cloud and Sentinel, and drive Security for AI practices with practical presentations and solutions.

Previously I led cloud security programs at CyberProof, partnering with some of the biggest enterprises in the world. I built flexible log collection and automation for Azure Sentinel, improved delivery with infrastructure as code, and created repeatable playbooks that teams could run with confidence.

I enjoy troubleshooting and teaching. I write a lot of PowerShell, refine detections, and focus on results that stick.

This blog shares lessons from real projects across cloud security, AI security, Sentinel, and automation.
